I first began coding in high school, in a computer science class in which we were taught an out-of-use language called NetLogo. The language involved manipulating objects called turtles, which could move, draw lines, and be represented as actual turtles on the computer screen (or any other image we desired) based on the programs we created. 

As the class progressed, we went from coding seemingly useless functions to solve basic algebra to seeing how the turtles could be used to visually model scientific principles or recreate classic video games, among other applications. I vividly remember a project left behind by a previous student called "Evil Tetris" which would determine and give the least helpful piece each turn in a game of tetris.    

Although the language is forgotton now, concepts like booleans, looping and recursion stayed with me (as well as turtle objects). When I code I am reminded that problems can be solved step by step, and small bits of code can build up to a project that has many layers and applications. Similarily through the Flatiron program, I hope to build my skills step by step to become a skilled developer.
