For my React/Redux final project, I decided to build a game.

I recreated the card game Deuces, also known as Big Two, or Chinese Poker. Players are dealt a hand of cards and take turn making valid plays. The first person to play all their cards wins.

I used the create-react-app to build the front-end of my site, and a rails API to store game data of win/loss records. I also used the [Deck of Cards API](http://deckofcardsapi.com/) to fetch and shuffle decks of cards, and to draw hands. In addition, I used foreman to serve my React and Rails servers simultaneously from one directory.
